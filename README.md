# focus

*A run-or-raise application switcher for any X11 desktop*

The idea is simple â€” bind a key for any given application that will:

- focus the application's most recently opened window, if it is running
- with additional flags (-o) launch the application, if it's not already running.
- Using command agin will cycle to the application's next window, if there's more than one and one is focused already (this only works when use as keybind).
